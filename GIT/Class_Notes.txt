		Agile Methodologies :::
		
		Iterations 1:	(Module)
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code/Development 
			Test 
						Deployment/Implementation 
						monitor/Maintain

		Iterations 2:
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code/Development 
			Test 
						Deployment/Implementation 
						monitor/Maintain
			
		Iterations 3:
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code/Development 
			Test 
						Deployment/Implementation 
						monitor/Maintain
			
		Using Agile Methodologies we can able to achieve Continuous Delivery. But, NOT Continuous Deployment.

		DevOps :: -- Process Perspective ::: 
		
		DevOps Engg. :::
		
				Build a colaboration between the teams::::
		
		SDLC :
			Teams :::
			
				- Business Analyst
				- Developers
				- QA - Testing
				- Operation Team
				- DBA 
				- Infra Architects
				- Release Management Team 
				- Maintain/Deployment 
				
			Technically :
			
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 			===> Provision/Create the servers --> IAC Tools(Terraform) 
				- Application Development Team				===> Coding/Development ==> IDEs --> GIT/Jenkins
				- Testing Team 								===> Automate Testing Testing - Integration with Notification Tools - Jenkins
				- Release Management Team					===> Automated Deployment - Ansible/Docker/Kubernetes
				- Production Support Team / Monitoring Team ===> Monitoring Tools - Prometheus/Grafana/App-Dynamics
				- Security Team 							===> Static scan/Dynamic Scan security Tool.
	
			DevOps Team :::
			
				E_Commerce --> Portal ==> Deployed ==> 			
				
			Environments :::
			
			Non-Prod Environment														Production Environment
			
				DEV 		(Developers use this for development)
				Test 
					QA 
					UAT 											====>
					Pre-Prod/Staging 														Prod Environment
					
		
			DevOps Stages :::
			
				Continuous Development				-> Developers --> 
						Developers --> role of developer? --> coding & unit test.
						code
						build 
						create artifacts 
						publish the artifacts to artifactory library
						Unit Testing 
						promote the code to test environment
						Notifiy the testing team 
						
					Using DevOps process ::::
						Code --> commit the code to source code repository
						DevOps will automate rest of the process.
				
				Continuous Integration
						--> allows developers to continuously integrate the code for further testing
						
				Continuous Testing 
						--> Automated testing tools - Continuous Testing
				
				Continuous Delivery/Deployment 	==> Used for production Release activities.
				
						Continuous Delivery		==> Needs Manual approval for Production Release.
						Continuous Deployment	==> Automated Deployment to prod - Without any manual Approval.				
										This can be achieve based on Application Architecture.
				Continuous Monitoring
						--> Monitor the Infra-Structure & Application 
			
			
		Application Architecture ::
			
				- Monolith Application Architecture
				
						Software Application --> composed of various Modules. 
						These are tightly coupled applications.
				
				- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				
				Applications - are splitted into various services ::
				
			amazon.com :: - Web_Application :::
			
			- Sign_up			--> Micro-Service (3-tier Application- frontend/Application_logic/backend) -> Independently developed/Tested/Deployed to Prod
			- Sign-In 
			- Product Search
			- Add to cart 
			- place the order 
			- payment 
			- confirm the order 
			- track the order

		DevOps is a software Development Strategy, that helps to promote the colaboration between the Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment, in more automated fashion.
		
		DevOps Stages ::::
		
		Continuous Integration
		Continuous Delivery/Deployment
		
			amazon.com :: - Web_Application :::
			
			- Sign_up			--> Micro-Service (3-tier Application- frontend/Application_logic/backend) -> Independently developed/Tested/Deployed to Prod
			- Sign-In 			--> Micro-Service ( Developer1 ) -> Independently developed/Tested/Deployed to Prod - src code repo.
			- Product Search
			- Add to cart 
			- place the order 
			- payment 
			- confirm the order 
			- track the order
			
		Application Owners/Architects --> 
		
		
				Continuous Delivery/Deployment 	==> Used for production Release activities.
				
						Continuous Delivery		==> Needs Manual approval for Production Release.
						Continuous Deployment	==> Automated Deployment to prod - Without any manual Approval.				
										This can be achieve based on Application Architecture.
										
		
		Before we move the app to prod., 
			Security Audit ==> 
			
		
		
		Banking Applications ==> Online services 
		
				Prod_Deployment window ==> 4hr to 6 hrs.	===> Non-Business Hours 
		
			
		
		
		amazon		
		netflix
		facebook
		google   		Continuous Deployment 
		
			Assessment ==> 
			
			
		Tools Used :::
		
			Continuous Development						IDEs, GIT, Jenkins 
							Eclipse based IDEs 	--> Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Visual Studio 
							Application Build 	--> Process of Compiling the Source Code and Creating Artifacts.
							Eg.: Java Web Application - Maven/Springboot app framework (High Level Language)
									Compile
									create artifacts --> (Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)									
									Build Tools ==> Maven Build Tool
							
			Continuous Integration
							GIT,Jenkins 
							Testing Environment
								QA 		
								UAT 
							
			
			Continuous Delivery/Deployment
							Jenkins, Ansible,Docker,Kubernetes
							Deployment ??? 
							
								Just a process of copying the artifacts from one environment to another.
							
					Non-Prod Environment														Production Environment
					
						DEV 		(Developers use this for development)
						Test 
							QA 
							UAT 											====>
							Pre-Prod/Staging 														Prod Environment(Release)

		Version Control System using GIT - Cont...
		
			- What is VCS 
			- Types of VCS 
			- GIT 
			- How GIT add values to Development and DevOps
			- Installation of GIT 
			- Misc GIT Commands.
			
		Continuous Development ::::
		
			Developer --> IDEs for coding.
			
				index.html ==>		saved a  just a flat file. tested it successfully.
				
				<html>
				---
				---
				-
				---
				asdfasd
				asdfasdf
				
				asdfasdfsd
				
				-
				-
				</html>
				
			Version control the file.
			
				- index.html_v1.0
				- index.html_v1.1
				
			Version Control System:
			
				- It is used to Track the Changes
						- User_ID
						- Date/Time of Changes 
						- Unique Tag/Version#/Commit_ID
				- It is used to Version Control the file
				
			Types of Version Control System :::
			
				Local Version Control System
				Centralized Version Control System
				Distributed Version Control System
				
				
			index.html  --> added 5 lines 
				v1.0
			
			++5 
			
				v1.1
				
			GIT :::
				- Is Open Source Distributed Version Control System 
				- It is used to Manage & Version Control the Source Code Changes
				- It is used to Track the Changes 
				- It is used to Perform Parallel Development.(Branching)
				
			Type of Distributed VCS ::::
			
			
			GIT --> Manage & Version Control the Source Code Changes
			
				GIT File Workflow ::
				
				Create any file :::
				
				Physical Location of the file 
				
				Local Machine 																									Remote Server
				
				Working Space/Directory							Staging/Index Area 					Local Repository		==> Remote Repository
				
				index.jsp				--Add this file to >> 	index.jsp 	 		--commit to >>   index.jsp_v1.0			==> index.jsp_v1.0
				
				
				GIT Cli in Local Machine (Windows/Linux/Mac)
				
				Remote Server :::
				
				GIT GUI Version of GIT.
				Eg.: 
					GITHUB is one of the remote repositories.
					Bitbucket 
					Az repositories
					AWS Code Commit 
				
				
				GIT Branching Strategies ::
				
				GIT Remote Repository Handling ::
		
		
				Local Machine 																									Remote Server
				
				Working Space/Directory							Staging/Index Area 					Local Repository		==> Remote Repository file1.txt
				
					
			
				git clone 		--> It is used to clone or copy the entire remote repo. into local machine(Updates both working dir and local repo)
				
				git add 		--> add the changes from working dir. to staging area
				
				git commit 		--> commit the changes from staging area to local repo.
				
				git push		--> push the changes from local repo to remote repo.
				
				
				git fetch/pull	
					Used to get the incremental changes from remote repo to local machine.
				
				git fetch 	
					- It just check if there is any incremental changes exist in remote repo.
					- If any changes exist, it will update the changes in only local repo.- It will NOT update the working dir.
				
				git pull
					- It just check if there is any incremental changes exist in remote repo.
					- If any changes exist, it will update the changes in local repo. as well as in the working dir.
					
					
			Developers Workload ?????			
			
				- New project 			
				- Enhancement Project 				
				- Bugfix
